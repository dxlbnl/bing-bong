Schedule assistant for the EJC.

Initial points gathered from the facebook discussion:

- Schedule tool and workshop assistant
Timetable
  - Shows
  - Workshops

Area managers manage shows
Communicate updates to users
Central access to communications and schedules (big screen views, public ipad view)

Workshop booking for popular workshops? or a popularity meter

All shit hits the plan offline feature

Mobile & Offline first app | PWA
No signups needed

Workshops:
  - Space requirements
  - Props
  - Expertise level

Building it:
  - Test everything
  - Scalable backend? (heroku? urgh)
  - UX'ers have had a say


Technology:
  - Backend can be very plain (e.g. postgres + (hasura)[https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/index.html]?)
  - Frontend has to be a modern web framework. (e.g. svelte(with sapper), react (with next), vue (with nuxt)
